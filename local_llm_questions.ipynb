    "2. Build explicit prompts for each question-variable-option combination, instructing the model to answer with a value from the scale\n",
    "3. Send each prompt to the local llama.cpp server\n",
    "4. Collect responses\n",
    "5. Save all output in machine-readable CSV and JSON files for easy parsing\n",
